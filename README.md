# vscode-samples

This repository contains sample applications customized for Visual Studio Code. Each sample is a self contained workspace with configuration files specific to that folder. 

These examples use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). If you don't already have this installed globally then you can install with the following command:

``` bash
npm install -g gulp
```

Next, cd into the sample directory, run `npm install` to install any necessary dependencies, and then start code:


JavaScript sample:
``` bash
cd node-express-javascript
npm install
code .
```

TypeScript sample:
``` bash
cd node-express-typescript
npm install
code .
```

To run the sample application, press `F5` to start the server under the debugger and then browse to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
